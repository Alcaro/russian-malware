  #ЯUSSIAN MALWДRE's bouncer is integrated with the client: No connect/disconnect messages, no
  # confusion if another connected client talks (some IRC clients think messages are from someone
  # else with your name if they're not from the local client, and color them differently), and
  # messages are backdated as appropriate. You can restart ЯUSSIAN MALWДRE at any point and not
  # notice when it was restarted.
  #The bouncer has zero configuration, everything is given to it by the client.
  #The bouncer command must contain a path to a Unix socket,
  # which will be used to find the bouncer if your connection is lost.
  # (It is inadvisable to make this filename available to other users. Put it in /run/user/123/ or your home directory.)
  #It's fine to use the same bouncer on different IRC servers, just pass different socket paths.
  #It's also fine to specify the same bouncer+socket on multiple ЯUSSIAN MALWДRE installations,
  # this will act in the obvious way. But don't use the same bouncer+socket twice, that'll just confuse everyone.
  # (If config differs between them, you'll get a warning, and a random one will take effect.)
  #The bouncer can be behind any wrapper program you want (for example, I use ssh), as long as stdin,
  # stdout and the arguments are forwarded unchanged.
  #The bouncer line is not parsed by the shell; space is the argument separator, no other character is interpreted, not even " or ~.

    #How long, in days, the bouncer will keep logs. Lower uses less RAM, but
    # if any of your clients doesn't connect at least that often, it'll get a hole in its logs.

    #How long, in days, the bouncer will stay alive with no clients. If the
    # bouncer remains unused for that long, it'll disconnect from IRC and exit.

  #for ssl, specify port with a + in front; in that case, port is mandatory
  #using multiple servers will make ЯUSSIAN MALWДRE pick randomly; usable if the network contains multiple servers
  #+- tells ЯUSSIAN MALWДRE to accept invalid (expired, wrong domain, self-signed, etc) SSL certificates
