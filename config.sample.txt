  #ЯUSSIAN MALWДRE's bouncer is integrated with the client: No connect/disconnect messages, no
  # confusion if another connected client talks (some IRC clients color your messages differently,
  # no doubt some of them don't expect its own username to talk), and messages are backdated as
  # appropriate. You can restart ЯUSSIAN MALWДRE at any point and not notice when it was restarted.
  #The bouncer has zero configuration, everything is given to it by the client.
  #The bouncer command must also contain a path to a Unix socket,
  # which will be used to find the bouncer if your connection is lost.
  # (It is inadvisable to make this filename available to other users. Put it in /run/user/123/ or your home directory.)
  #It's fine to use the bouncer on different IRC servers, just pass different socket paths.
  #It's also fine to specify the same bouncer+socket on multiple ЯUSSIAN MALWДRE installations,
  # this will act in the obvious way.
  # (If config differs between them, you'll get a warning, and a random one will take effect.)
  #The bouncer can be behind any wrapper program you want (for example, I use ssh), as long as stdin,
  # stdout and the argument are forwarded unchanged.
  #The bouncer line is not parsed by the shell; don't use quotes, spaces or other funny symbols in the arguments.
