  # - you've used /join.
  #If not, the channel will appear if any of the above events happen. Shift-clicking a channel will hide it.

  #ЯUSSIAN MALWДRE supports several mute-like rules.
  #ping - If this user @mentions you, it shows up as a normal message.
  #activity - If this user speaks, it does not show up as activity, nor does it unhide the channel if semi-hidden.
  # However, if you look at the channel, the messages will show up. @mentions show up as mentions, unless mute=ping is set too.
  # This is the recommended mute level for people or bots who talk way too much, but aren't really harmful.
  #sponge - aLl pOsTs bY ThIs uSeR ArE ReWrItTeN To sPoNgEbOb cAsE.
  # This is the recommended mute level for bullies and other annoying people, if the moderators aren't willing to remove the user.
  # It avoids the "telephone problem"; people seemingly talking to nobody, because you have muted some participants of the conversation,
  #  while also making the post harder to read (and harder to take seriously), reducing the annoyance level.
  # It's recommended to combine this with mute=ping and mute=activity.
  #loose-u - Changes the words 'u' and 'U' to 'you' and 'You'.
  #guildemoji - All guildemoji posted by this user are replaced with random other emoji.
  #delete - Posts by this user are completely ignored and don't show up. Not recommended, due to the aforementioned telephone problem.
  #It's fine to set multiple mutes on the same user, for example
  user=188322172576464896 name="Sir Walrus" mute=activity mute=ping
  
  #You can override whether replying to specific users should ping.

  #This is your default activity, set on start. To change at runtime, use /status Watching paint dry or /play Undertale 2.

# The todo list "server" allows organizing timers in various ways.
# There are two kinds of timers: Bulk and exact. Exact are what you expect; bulk don't mark the "channel" active.
# Times are specified as 1y2w3d4h5m6s. 1y is exactly 365 days; ЯUSSIAN MALWДRE does not try to account for leap years.
# If all time rules are ywd, it's a bulk timer; if any is hms, it's an exact timer.
# You can also add +e +b -s to override whether it's bulk or exact, or has sound, for example 1w+e.
# You can set timers from any channel, if prefixed with /.
# There are also a few extra commands, that only work in the todo list's own channel.
# 'ls dinner' will print every timer whose message contains 'dinner', including time to expiry and their internal ID numbers.
# 'rm 123' will remove the timer with ID 123.
# 'rm dinner' will remove the unique timer whose message contains 'dinner'. If there are multiple or none, you'll get an error.
# 'reload' will reload the timer store from disk. This allows you to edit the todo list manually. Will reset all timer IDs.
todo=Todo store=todo.json
  # If sound is enabled, it will play when exact timers expire; bulk timers are silent.
  # If the timer is short (less than four hours), the assigned sound will be the first from the list
  #  that's not used for any other timer within four hours; if long, it's just random.
  # ЯUSSIAN MALWДRE does not natively support sound; it's implemented via a shell command.
  # {} will be replaced with the filename, and & will be automatically appended.
