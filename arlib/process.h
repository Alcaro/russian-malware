//On Linux, you must be careful about creating child processes through other functions. Make sure
// they don't fight over any process-global resources.
//More specifically, all SIGCHLD handlers must chain to the previous one, using the three-argument sigaction function;
// they may not attempt concurrent installation with Arlib (sequential is fine); and they may not attempt to uninstall them.
//Additionally, nothing may use waitpid(-1).
//From what I can gather, g_spawn_*(), popen() and system() are safe.
// However, g_child_watch_*() and GSubprocess are not; they install a SIGCHLD handler and discard the old one.
//I have not analyzed Qt.
