// TODO: rewrite this thing
// - creating a socket should be async, this DNS-then-forward wrapper is silly (socks5 should be async too)
// - backpressure; socketbuf is flawed at best, socket::write must be async
// - concurrency pushback; object X may only handle one concurrent event
//     for example a GUI program that sends HTTP requests; nested GUI event handling is impossible to reason about
//     another example: simply an echo server
//       read "hello ", async write "hello "
//       read "world\n", async write "world\n"
//     they must be in the right order, and a bounded number, so the next read must be delayed until the write is done
//   for extra fun:
//   - object X may handle multiple fds
//   - object X may call into object Y, which also handles events
//   - all relevant overhead must be optimized out as far as possible
//   - an async function must be cancellable, without leaking anything important
//   proposed solution:
//     there is such a thing as an async context, which contains zero or more sockets
//     an async context is usually idle, meaning it's trying to read all its sockets
//     while the handler is running (including waiting for an async write), incoming data on those sockets is ignored
//     you can also submit a function<async void()> to a context, which marks that context busy and runs the function
//       TODO: what if it's busy already?
//     timers and gui events do not belong in an async context, and cannot be async
//   this can be done by giving async functions a lock argument, whose dtor releases the context, unless moved into a lambda capture
//   however, that is very error prone, and requires nesting lambdas forever
//   it'd be a lot easier with c++20 coroutines, which will probably be available in gcc 11, and most likely to me in 2022
//   cancellation can probably be done by running that coro and forcing the object to return failure, unless coros allow something better
// - make socket handler less easy to screw up
//     for example, if a HTTP handler reads only half of the output from a SSL socket, its ready callback must run again immediately
//     this is currently SSL's responsibility, and the exact rules are pretty subtle - I doubt I did it right everywhere
//   proposed solution: sockets have an is_ready() function, and runloop loops that as necessary
//                      would also allow removing the gameview::tmp_step lamehack
// - decide if I want the runloop in a thread local variable, instead of passing it around and calling runloop::global everywhere
//   advantages: less boilerplate; no need to store runloop pointers everywhere; DECL_TIMER becomes trivial
//   disadvantages: TLS is tricky, especially regarding destructors; it's a global variable (though runloop::global is global already);
//                  may complicate testing; explicit is better
//   (if yes, use a global object's ctor to assign the GUI runloop to the main thread)
// - allows plenty of cleanups across all of Arlib; grep for TODO
// should also remove the idle/relative/absolute/repeat distinction, oneshot relative only; the others are too rare
// the above should be done once c++20 coroutines are in place, they'll require rewriting the entire thing already
// c++20 coro will also allow me to delete most of those callback functions, instead tracking which sockets have a coro trying to read

// for Windows, I should base it mostly or exclusively on alertable I/O / APC completion routines (ReadFileEx, WSARecv),
//  since they seem to be the most general mechanism (few other things allow awaiting a pipe)
// they also allow me to exceed the MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS limit, 64 is way too low
// the alternative would be I/O completion ports, which allows completing the operation on a thread it wasn't started on,
//  but I'm not gonna do that anyways
// they also interact poorly with the message pump prior to windows 10 and seem harder to use, so alert it is

//A runloop keeps track of a number of file descriptors, calling their handlers whenever the relevant operation is available.
//Event handlers must handle the event. If they don't, the handler may be called again forever and block everything else.
//Do not call enter() or step() while inside a callback. The others are safe.
//A runloop is less thread safe than most objects. It may only ever be use from one thread, even if access is serialized.
//Anything placed inside a runloop (socket, process, ...) gains the same thread affinity.
