#ifdef AROPENGL_D3DSYNC
		//Direct3D vsync is an advanced feature that uses WGL_NV_DX_interop and
		//  D3DSWAPEFFECT_FLIPEX to ensure smooth framerate on Windows.
		//(Despite the name, it works on both Intel, AMD and Nvidia.)
		//Advantages:
		//- Less stuttering, especially with DWM enabled (at least on some computers, sometimes vsync is already smooth)
		//Disadvantages:
		//- Requires Windows 7 or newer
		//- May not work on all graphics cards and drivers
		//- Poorly tested driver path, may be slow or buggy (in fact, I believe I found a Nvidia driver bug while creating it)
		//- You may not render to the default framebuffer, 0; you must render to gl.outputFramebuffer()
		//    (if you don't use framebuffers, you can ignore this; outputFramebuffer is bound on creation)
		//- Swap intervals other than 0 and 1 are not supported, not even -1
		//- May be slightly slower, especially with vsync off; it does an extra render pass
		//    (this pass contains only a single Direct3DDevice9Ex->StretchRect, so it's fast, but nonzero)
		//The flag is ignored on non-Windows systems.
		//It is safe to use gl.outputFramebuffer on non-d3dsync objects, even outside Windows.
